DynaMITe consists of a backbone, a feature decoder, and an interactive Transformer. Point features at click
locations at time t are translated into queries which, along with the multi-scale features, are processed by a Transformer
encoder-decoder structure to generate a set of output masks &#8499;<sup>t</sup> for all the relevant objects. Based on Mt, the user provides
a new input click which is in turn used by the interactive Transformer to generate a new set of updated masks &#8499;<sup>t+1</sup>. This
process is then iterated Ï„ times until the masks are fully refined.
